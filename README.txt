My python program is compiled with python3, and the numpy library needs to be installed with "pip3 install --user numpy" or something similar, the latter works on stdlinux. 

use python3 aes128.py e/d key inputFile

no extra credit was done (something came up and i didnt have as much time as i had hoped), the file output works as described.

the test cases i have in my input file all work and were verified by an online tool at https://testprotect.com/appendix/AEScalc

there are two testcases that also demonstrate how my program handles input too large and too small as desired

finally i have included both the inputFile.enc and the inputFile.enc.dec

cool project :P
